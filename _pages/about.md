I am an assistant professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computer-science) at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/). I received my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) where I had the good fortune to be advised by [Prof. Ramesh Govindan](https://govindan.usc.edu/). Before that, I received the Presidential Medal, and the University Gold Medal for my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar](https://www.uetpeshawar.edu.pk/).

In my research, I build the foundations for live 3D digital twins — entities that continuously capture, update, and understand the world around us. To do this, my work advances real-time cooperative and infrastructure-enhanced 3D perception, develops compact representations for sharing 3D data at scale, and creates adaptive systems that sustain low-latency perception under real-world constraints. This lays the groundwork for Physical AI with applications in autonomous driving, smart cities, sports analytics, drone navigation, and mixed reality.

**Note for Potential Students:** I am always looking for motivated and hardworking PhD/Masters/undergraduate students to join my group. For RIT students, I prefer working with students who have taken a course with me. For other students (including RIT students who have not taken my course) who are interested in working with me, before sending me an email, please do your due deligience in understanding the type of work we do in our lab by going through recent publications. This will improve our chances of working together.

**Note for Industry Collaborations:**
I welcome opportunities to work with industry partners to explore new ideas and translate research into real-world impact. If you’re interested in collaboration, I’d be happy to connect, please shoot me an email.
