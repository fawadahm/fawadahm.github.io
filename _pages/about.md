I am an assistant professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computer-science) at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/). My research focuses on building mobile systems that enable humans and machines like self-driving cars, and drones to perceive, and understand the world better. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) where I was advised by [Prof. Ramesh Govindan](https://govindan.usc.edu/). Before that, I received the Presidential Medal, and the University Gold Medal for my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar](https://www.uetpeshawar.edu.pk/).

**I am looking for motivated and hardworking students to join my group. If you are interested in working with me and have read some of my papers, please send me an email.**
