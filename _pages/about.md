I am an assistant professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computer-science) at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/). My research focuses on building mobile systems that enable humans and machines like self-driving cars, and drones to perceive, and understand the world better. 

I received my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) where I was advised by [Prof. Ramesh Govindan](https://govindan.usc.edu/). Before that, I received the Presidential Medal, and the University Gold Medal for my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar](https://www.uetpeshawar.edu.pk/).

**Note for Potential Students:** I am always looking for motivated and hardworking PhD/Masters/undergraduate students to join my group. For RIT students, I prefer working with students who have taken a course with me. For other students (including RIT students who have not taken my course) who are interested in working with me, before sending me an email, please do your due deligience in understanding the type of work we do in our lab by going through recent publications. This will improve our chances of working together significantly.
