In the Fall semester, I teach an introductory computer vision course i.e., CSCI-431 (Introduction to Computer Vision). 
In this course, besides computer vision fundamentals, we also go over 3D sensing, and applications of machine learning in computer vision.

In the Spring semester, I teach a graduate seminar on autonomous driving CSCI-739 (Intelligence for Autonomous Driving).
In this course, we go over recent interdisciplinary literature on autonomous driving.
